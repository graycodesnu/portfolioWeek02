# porftolioWeek02

## Introduction

This project is a reulst of our boot camp's week 2 homework assignment. Students were expected to create a portfolion in the form of our own web application from scratch. This application is to be used as our portfolio as we progress throughout the course and our job search and can be found [here](https://graycodesnu.github.io/portfolioWeek02/). The assignment required us to meet several requirements outlined in the next section.

## Goals

The goal of this assignment was to create a portfolio using several of the skills we've acquired throughout the first few weeks of boot camp, which we can continue to build upon as we progress and expand our portfolio. This iteration of our portfolio was required to have the following:

+ Introduction, Iroject, and Contact sections 
+ Navbar/header links that take the use to the corresponding sections on the page
+ Project section with titled images linked to previously deployed work
+ A larger linked image representing our first project
+ A responsive layout that adopts to the user's viewport

## Results 

I had some difficulty formatting the navbar element fall inline with my header, but was able to create a responsive header/navbar after a tutoring session. The same is true for the About section, however, I was able to research and discover different methods for building this aspect of my project and ensuring that the text of this section would fall inline with my image and be responsive. In order for the images representing my projectS to fall inline, I used a photo grid for the first time. Ensuring these photos falled inline evenly was difficult, but I was able to use a class tag in order to group them together. As for the Contact section, this was probably the easiest portion of the project, as I only included text. I attempted to group each form of contact together to have each box fall inline and to be more compatible with different-sized viewports, but was admittedly unsuccessful.

Moving forward, I aim to experiment more with image and text formatting, as well as flexbox in order to further my understanding.As I continue to build upon this iteration of my portfolio, I would like to incorporate cleaner, more adaptive formatting, as well as more pseudo elements; especially for the linked attributes and contact sections.
